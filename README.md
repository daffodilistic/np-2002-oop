# XYZ Parking Java Application
My assignment submission for my polytechnic module in object-oriented programming, circa 2002

## Running the application
1. Open this repository folder in VS Code and start debugging (either via the Play button, or F5 key).
2. Yes this still runs with no code changes required.
